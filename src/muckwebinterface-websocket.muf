( 
A program to provide websocket functionality between the muck and a webpage via a websocket.
It provides functionality to support the webpage, it is NOT the program that handles the direct webclient.

This version works on top of the MuckWebInterface and is greatly simplified from the previous version since it doesn't require a HTTP stream.
 
The initial connection requires a 'token' that is retrieved from the main webpage, ensuring it handles authentication.

Present support - Websockets should now be universal and all the browsers that don't support them have been retired.

Assumes the muck takes time to re-use descrs, in particular that their is sufficient time to see a descr is disconnected before it is re-used.

Message are sent over channels, programs register to 'watch' a channel.
On each message the program looks for functions on registered programs in the form 'on<messsage>' and passes them the message.
These functions are called with the arguments 'channel, message, descr, player, data'; Player may be #-1.

Communication is sent in the form of a three letter code prefixing the line. Message formats used:
MSGChannel,Message,Data       Standard message sent over a channel. Data is JSON encoded
SYSMessage,Data               System messages without a channel.
Ping / Pong                   Handled at the transport level

Underlying transmission code attempts to minimize the amount encoding by not doing it for every recipient
Approximate transmission route:
[Public send request functions through various SendToX methods]
[Requests broken down into a list of descrs and the message, ending in sendMessageToDescrs]
[Message is encoded appropriately once and sent to each websocket]

The connection details stored in connections:
    descr: Descr for connection. The dictionary is also indexed by this.
    pid: PID of client process
    player: Associated player dbref
    account: Associated account - stored so we're not reliant on player for the reference
    channels: String list of channels joined
    connectedAt: Time of connection
    acceptedAt: Time connection handshake completed
    properties: keyValue list if properties set on a connection
    ping: Last performance between ping sent and ping received
    lastPingOut: Systime_precise a pending ping was issued.
    lastPingIn: Systime_precise a pending ping was received

Properties on program:
    debugLevel: Present debug level. Only read on load, as it's then cached due to constant use.
    @channels/<channel>/<programDbref>:<program creation date> - Programs to receive messages for a channel.
    disabled:If Y the system will prevent any connections

(TBC: Ensure no references to firstconnect, lastconnection, connectiontype, upgrading or httpstream remain)
